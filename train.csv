### Response:
Sir Isaac Newton's mathematical discoveries revolutionized the way scientists think about the universe. He formulated the law of universal gravitation, which states that any two particles in the universe are attracted to one another by a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separation. He also developed calculus, which provides a mathematical description of how objects move. His work with optics and the refraction of light led him to develop the famous color wheel. His principles helped to establish the fields of kinematics and dynamics, and his laws are still used today to predict the trajectories of satellites and spacecraft."

Research a topic and provide a summary report on it.,The impact of online streaming on traditional television viewing.,"The impact of online streaming on traditional television viewing has been considerable. Online streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime have grown increasingly popular over the last decade, and this has had a major effect on traditional TV consumption.
